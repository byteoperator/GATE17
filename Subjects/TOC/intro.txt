The fundamental unit of "Formal Languages and Authomata Theory" is a SET : a set of characters.

English is a language made from a set of 26 characters, a through z, plus some special punctuation characters and whitespaces.

English is a Set. Every language is a Set. Set of what?
Set of all possible words in the language. But English is not a formal language.

In Automata theory, we study about Formal languages only. Formal languages are the ones that cab be formally described 
using mathemtical tools (Set theory).
E.g. - C, Java, C++, Python, all programming are formal languages. They are well defined in terms of sytax and semantics without ambiguity.

Formal languages are classified into a number  of types based on their power or strength, determined by the number of words present
in that language. The classification is known as Chomsky Hierarchy of languages, by the name of the person Noam Chomsky.

Word == String == A collection of characters from the underlying Character Set

Q. What is the smallest language possible?
    A language which has no words at all, or zero words.
    This language is special. Called as the Null language, Null set, Empty language, etc.
    Denoted by Φ (phi).
    It is a formal language for sure, as it can be well defined in terms of an empty / null set.
    
Q. What is the largest language possible?
    An infinite language comprising of all the possible combinations of words from the underlying charset.
    Can not be enumerated.
    Has a special notation using Klnee-star (*).
    If the underlying character set is Σ, then the set of all possible words in the language is denoted by Σ*.
    
Q. What is Java?
    Java is a set.
    Funny but true answer. No one can disagree with reason.
    Every formal language is a set.
